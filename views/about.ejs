                <hr>
                <p>We are a ministry of Grace Community Church on the UCLA campus. We are a student group that exists to
                    glorify God and spread a passion for His glory by making disciples, shepherding them to value Jesus
                    Christ above all else, and training up the next generation of Christian leaders. In other words,
                    we exist to edify and equip the saints, evangelize the lost, and exalt the Lord Jesus Christ in all
                    things.</p>

                <h3>The Sinfulness of Man</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>When man was first created, man was in a perfect relationship with God. However, man sinned and disobeyed
                    God’s law, ruining and distorting the perfect relationship between God and man. The Bible says that
                    every man is guilty of sin and has offended God. According to God’s absolutely holy and just character,
                    He cannot approve of evil and declares that the punishment for sin is death and eternity spent in
                    hell. However, in His loving kindness and mercy, He provided a way for man to be saved from the punishment
                    of sin! (Romans 3:22-23, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 1:18)</p>
                <br/>

                <h3>God's Plan of Redemption</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>God’s plan to save man from His wrath was carried out through Jesus Christ. God so loved the world that
                    He sent his only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. In the
                    face of persecution, suffering, and crucifixion, Jesus Christ never once gave into temptation and
                    sinned. Instead, Jesus lived a completely righteous life and offered it up as a perfect sacrifice
                    on behalf of all who would have faith in Him. Through Jesus’ death, God’s wrath is miraculously satisfied,
                    the punishment is finally paid for, and man is fully forgiven of his sin. Three days after His crucifixion,
                    Jesus resurrected victoriously from death, securing hope for all who would trust in Him. (John 3:16,
                    1 Corinthians 15:3-5, Romans 5:1, Romans 5:6, Romans 8:1)

                <h3>God's Call for Man to Be Saved</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Saving faith in Christ is a gracious gift of God where the Holy Spirit transforms a person’s heart and
                    opens his/her eyes to the gospel. At the same time, God calls every person to wholeheartedly repent
                    from their sin, to believe in and commit his/her life to Jesus Christ. (Romans 10:10-13, John 3:36,
                    John 14:6, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 1:16)</p>
