                <hr>
                <p>Small groups are the backbone of our discipleship ministry. Each small group focuses on Bible study, prayer, fellowship, and accountability. In these smaller, more intimate groups, we have the opportunity to develop deep relationships so that we can better love, serve, and care for each other. Each small group has a leader who will minister to your spiritual needs, counsel you through lifeâ€™s tough issues, and spur you on in your walk with the Lord.</p>
