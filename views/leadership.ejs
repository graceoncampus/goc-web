                        <p>Matt was born in San Francisco and raised in a Christian home, coming to saving faith at a young age. He moved to Los Angeles to attend UCLA, and became actively involved at Grace on Campus and Grace Community Church during his college years. A graduate of The Masterâ€™s Seminary, he has served as the shepherd of Grace on Campus since 2021. Matt and his wife Kimmie (also from San Francisco and a UCLA alum) are blessed with three boys and a girl. In their spare time, the Ngs enjoy watching the Warriors when they win, visiting coffee shops around town, and smoking meat in their backyard smoker.
